BunsenLabs Papirus Icon Theme
=============================

Some substituted icons for the Papirus icon theme.

The default blue folder icons in Papirus have been overridden
by copies of the grey and bluegrey variants also provided in that theme.

The icon themes were generated from Papirus using the script
papirus-folder-color.sh available here:
https://gist.github.com/johnraff/0fd5b6e7890377a12bae9f5accdaf295

They inherit Papirus, and depend on papirus-icon-theme.
